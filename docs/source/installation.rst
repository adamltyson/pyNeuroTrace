Installation
============

pyNeuroTrace can be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install pyNeuroTrace

If you wish to use optional GPU-accelerated modules, install pyNeuroTrace with this modification:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install pyNeuroTrace[GPU]

Or ensure that `Cupy` is installed in your Python environment and that you have a CUDA-enabled graphics card.
